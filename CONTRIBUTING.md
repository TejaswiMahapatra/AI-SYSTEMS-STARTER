## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please check if the issue already exists. If it does, add a comment with any additional information.

**When filing a bug report, include:**
- **Clear title** - Describe the issue in one sentence
- **Steps to reproduce** - How did you encounter this bug?
- **Expected behavior** - What should have happened?
- **Actual behavior** - What actually happened?
- **Environment details** - OS, Python version, Docker version
- **Logs/Screenshots** - If applicable
- **Possible fix** - If you have an idea (optional)

**Example:**
\`\`\`markdown
## Bug: Agent timeout on large documents

**Environment:** macOS 14.0, Python 3.11, Docker 24.0

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Upload a PDF larger than 50 pages
2. Query with agent endpoint
3. Agent times out after 300s

**Expected:** Agent should handle large documents
**Actual:** TimeoutError after 300s

**Logs:**
\`\`\`
ERROR - Ollama request timed out
\`\`\`

**Possible fix:** Implement streaming or chunked processing
\`\`\`

### Suggesting Features

We love new ideas! Before suggesting a feature:
1. Check if it's already been suggested
2. Make sure it aligns with the project's goals
3. Provide a clear use case

**When suggesting features, include:**
- **Problem statement** - What problem does this solve?
- **Proposed solution** - How would you implement it?
- **Alternatives considered** - Other ways to solve it
- **Use cases** - Who benefits from this?

**Example:**
\`\`\`markdown
## Feature: Multi-language document support

**Problem:** Currently only supports English legal documents.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Add language detection in PDF service
- Support multilingual embeddings (e.g., multilingual-MiniLM)
- Update prompts for non-English queries

**Use Cases:**
- International law firms
- Cross-border contracts
- European legal documents

**Alternatives:**
- Translation layer (less accurate)
- Language-specific models (more complex)
\`\`\`

### Improving Documentation

Documentation is crucial! You can help by:
- Fixing typos or unclear explanations
- Adding examples or tutorials
- Translating documentation
- Writing blog posts or guides

**Documentation locations:**
- \`README.md\` - Project overview
- \`docs/getting-started.md\` - Setup guide
- \`ARCHITECTURE.md\` - Technical details
- \`backend/\` - Inline code comments
- \`examples/\` - Usage examples

### Contributing Code

We accept contributions for:
- Bug fixes
- New features
- Performance improvements
- Test coverage
- Code refactoring

**Before starting on major features:**
1. Open an issue to discuss your idea
2. Get feedback from maintainers
3. Align on the approach
4. Then start coding!

This prevents wasted effort if the feature doesn't align with project goals.

\`\`\`

## Coding Guidelines

### Python Style

We follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) with these specifics:

**Code Formatting:**
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Add docstrings for all public functions/classes

**Example:**
\`\`\`python
async def process_document(
    file_path: str,
    collection_name: str,
    chunk_size: int = 500
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Process a document and store it in the vector database.

    Args:
        file_path: Path to the PDF file
        collection_name: Target Weaviate collection
        chunk_size: Maximum characters per chunk (default: 500)

    Returns:
        Dict containing document_id, num_chunks, and processing time

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If file_path doesn't exist
        ValueError: If collection_name is invalid
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
\`\`\`

**Naming Conventions:**
- \`snake_case\` for functions and variables
- \`PascalCase\` for classes
- \`UPPER_CASE\` for constants
- Descriptive names (avoid single letters except in loops)

**Good:**
\`\`\`python
def calculate_confidence_score(search_results: List[VectorSearchResult]) -> float:
    avg_score = sum(r.score for r in search_results) / len(search_results)
    return min(avg_score, 1.0)
\`\`\`

**Bad:**
\`\`\`python
def calc(sr):
    s = sum(r.score for r in sr) / len(sr)
    return min(s, 1.0)
\`\`\`

### Async/Await

- Use \`async/await\` for I/O operations
- Don't block the event loop with synchronous operations
- Use \`asyncio.gather()\` for parallel async calls

### Error Handling

- Use specific exception types
- Log errors with context
- Return meaningful error messages

\`\`\`python
try:
    result = await process_document(file_path, collection_name)
except FileNotFoundError:
    logger.error(f"File not found: {file_path}")
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=f"File not found: {file_path}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Processing failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
    raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Processing failed: {str(e)}")
\`\`\`

### Testing

When adding tests:
- Write unit tests for individual functions
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Use meaningful test names: \`test_should_return_error_when_file_not_found\`
- Mock external dependencies (Ollama, Weaviate)
